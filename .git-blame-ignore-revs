# This file contains revisions to be ignored by git blame.
# These revisions are expected to be formatting-only changes.
#
# Calling `git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs` will
# tell git blame to ignore changes made by these revisions when assigning
# assigning blame, as if the change never happened.
#
# You can enable this as a default for your local repository by running
# `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`
# Important: if you do this, then switch to a branch without this file,
# `git blame` will fail with an error.
#

# Add a clang-format and format the code accordingly
