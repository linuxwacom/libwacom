# Example model file description for a tablet
#
# Make sure to give it a recognisable name, with the ".tablet" suffix
[Device]

# The name is the vendor and product name announced by the kernel
Name=Wacom Intuos4 6x9

# DeviceMatch includes the bus (usb, bluetooth, serial), the vendor ID and
# product ID. This is the connector used, not whatever name the kernel
# might give it, so some "Wacom Serial" builtin devices will be USB
# as that's how they're connected.
#
# For example:
# $ lsusb | grep Wacom
# Bus 002 Device 003: ID 056a:00bc Wacom Co., Ltd Intuos4 6x9
# will give you the device match below.
#
# You can find a full list of known Device IDs at:
# https://github.com/linuxwacom/input-wacom/wiki/Device-IDs
#
# Do not add 0x in front of the hex numbers, make sure to pad each ID
# so it has exactly 4 digits.
DeviceMatch=usb:056a:00bc

# Paired PID includes the match line of any device that share the same
# physical device but has different product or vendor ids (e.g. the touch
# device on the 24HDT). The format of the match line is identical to
# DeviceMatch but only one value is permitted.
# Note: the PIDs listed may not be libwacom devices themselves.
PairedIDs=usb:056a:0335

# Class of the tablet. Valid classes include Intuos3, Intuos4, Graphire, Bamboo, Cintiq
# If unsure, or not applicable (the tablet isn't stand-alone for
# example), just leave it out.
Class=Intuos4

# (Optional) Width in inches, as advertised by the manufacturer
Width=9

# (Optional) Height in inches, as advertised by the manufacturer
Height=6

# Integration flags, is the tablet is part of the system, such as a
# TabletPC or integrated in the screen, ie a screen tablet (most serial
# tablets, Cintiqs)
# Note, if unspecified, the integration flags will be taken from the kernel.
# Using an empty value or "None" forces the intergration flags to remain unset
# even if the relevant kernel flags would state otherwise.
IntegratedIn=Display;System

# Styli
#
# This is a list of stylus IDs supported by the tablet. This is the
# hardest thing to gather, but note that this is only needed for the
# professional range of tablets, as the consumer range of devices all
# have a single stylus (stylus + 2 buttons + eraser), just like our
# generic stylus.
#
# Consumer range:
# - Graphire
# - Bamboo
#
# Professional range:
# - Cintiq
# - Intuos
#
# In general, differently sized models of the same range support the same
# styli, so you can copy/paste the list from another definition.
#
# After that, you can try piecing the stylus list from the names of the
# styli in libwacom.stylus, using the Wacom webshop as a reference
# (how many supported styli, what do they look like, etc.)
#
# Finally, if you cannot find any information about the styli supported
# by your device, you will need to gather the "Wacom Serial IDs",
# and getting each stylus closer to the tablet.
Styli=0x802;0x804;0x40802;0x80c;0x80a;0x4080a;0x90a;0x20802;0x902;

# Optional features that this tablet supports
# Some features are dependent on the actual tool used, e.g. not all styli
# have an eraser and some styli have additional custom axes (e.g. the
# airbrush pen). These features describe those available on the tablet.
#
# Features not set in a file default to false/0

[Features]
# This tablet supports styli (and erasers, if present on the actual stylus)
Stylus=true

# Whether the tablet can be used left-handed
# This is only for stand-alone tablets. The tablet
# is deemed reversible if the tablet can be turned 180 degrees
# so buttons are placed on the other side. The Intuos4 tablet
# is a great example of that.
Reversible=true

# This tablet supports touch.
Touch=false

# This tablet provides a hardware touch switch.
TouchSwitch=false

# This tablet has a touch ring (Intuos4 and Cintiq 24HD)
# A touch ring is a circular button that responds to touch
# (rather than clicks):
